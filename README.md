# 👋 Hey, I’m Dan (CodeHalwell)

Analytical Chemist → Data Scientist / AI Engineer  
Currently poking at large language models and automation at scale.  
Based in the rainy half of the UK, trying to use AI for things that actually matter.

---

## 🧪 What I do

- Build tooling around LLMs (config, orchestration, agents, RAG)
- Bridge scientific thinking with data & AI in pharma and healthcare
- Prototype ideas fast, then slowly make them less embarrassing
- Care about responsible, human-centred, climate-conscious tech rather than “move fast and break society”

---

## 🔭 Current focus

- **`yamllm`** – YAML-first configuration for LLMs so you can swap models, prompts and memory without rewriting half your code
- **Agentic AI** – workflows, tools and MCP servers for actually useful agents rather than “yet another chat box”
- **RAG & evaluation** – small, focused retrieval systems and ways to check if the model is talking sense
- **Developer ergonomics** – scripts, CLIs and templates to make working with LLMs less fiddly and more reproducible

## 📌 Pinned work

### Agent frameworks & orchestration

- **[AgentGuides](https://github.com/CodeHalwell/AgentGuides)**  
  A big, opinionated set of guides for building AI agents across **16+ frameworks & SDKs**  
  (OpenAI Agents, SmolAgents, CrewAI, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, PydanticAI, Bedrock, Claude, etc.) – with deployment patterns, diagrams and copy-pasteable recipes.

- **[yamllm](https://github.com/CodeHalwell/yamllm)**  
  A Python library for **YAML-first LLM configuration & execution**.  
  Keep prompts, models, tools, memory, parameters and routing in config instead of burying them in scripts. Good for reproducible experiments and swapping providers without rewiring everything.

### Research & assistants

- **[deep-research](https://github.com/CodeHalwell/deep-research)**  
  An **agent-based research workflow** built on LlamaIndex and MCP.  
  Multi-agent pipeline (planning → research → writing → review → formatting → summary) with web/academic search, PDF generation and human-in-the-loop quality gates.

- **[gradio-mcp-agent-hack](https://github.com/CodeHalwell/gradio-mcp-agent-hack)**  
  A **multi-agent “shallow research” + code assistant** wired through a Gradio MCP server.  
  Integrates with VS Code / MCP clients, runs generated Python in sandboxed Modal environments, and focuses on grounded research plus executable answers.

### Interfaces & personal tooling

- **[code_chat_bot](https://github.com/CodeHalwell/code_chat_bot)**  
  Multi-provider **Streamlit LLM app** (OpenAI, Mistral, Anthropic, Cohere).  
  Chat about code, load documents/URLs, swap models mid-conversation, and keep an eye on token spend.

- **[digital-cv](https://github.com/CodeHalwell/digital-cv)**  
  An **AI-powered digital CV** built with Gradio.  
  Lets people chat with “me” about experience, projects and skills; supports contact capture, question tracking and analytics, all driven from my actual CV and profile docs.

## 🛠️ Toolbox

**Languages & data**

- Python, little bit of SQL, little bit of TypeScript, a dash of notebook-driven experimentation
- Pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter, PyTorch, TensorFlow, transformers

**LLMs & agents**

- OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, etc. via APIs  
- LlamaIndex, LangGraph, various agent frameworks  
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers & clients  
- RAG systems, research agents, evaluation workflows

**Apps & orchestration**

- Streamlit & Gradio for quick UIs  
- n8n & workflow-style automation  
- Docker, `uv`, virtualenvs and the usual Python plumbing

---

## 🧠 How I think

- Science first: hypotheses, experiments, evidence  
- Data & models should be **interpretable, reproducible and testable**
- Prefer open standards and open source over lock-in where possible
- Tech should make people’s lives better, not just someone’s quarterly earnings

---

## 🌱 Outside the code

When I’m not coding, I’m usually:

- Reading about AI, systems design, economics, science
- Exploring how we can use AI to improve our lives
- Refactoring yesterday’s “quick hack” into something future-me might forgive
